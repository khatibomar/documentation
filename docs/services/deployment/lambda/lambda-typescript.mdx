# AWS Lambda + TypeScript

## Deploying services as AWS Lambda functions

You can run your Restate services as serverless functions on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

:::tip
The easiest way to run Restate handlers on AWS Lambda is to use the [Restate CDK construct library](/services/deployment/cdk).
:::

To deploy a Restate service as a Lambda function, you can follow the [guidelines of AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/typescript-package.html)
for deploying plain TypeScript NodeJS functions. Restate does not add any complexity to this. You build a zip file containing the application code and dependencies and upload this to AWS Lambda. If you are using the Restate node template, then you can create a zip file with:

```
npm run bundle
```

AWS Lambda assumes that the handler can be found under `index.handler` in the uploaded code.
By default, this is also the case for the Lambda functions developed with the Restate SDK.


## Managed service
If you'd prefer not to manage a runtime instance, we are trialing a managed service that lets you work
with Lambda services without running any infrastructure.
See [the documentation](/restate/restate_cloud) for more details.

## Discovery of services

To let Restate discover the services, execute the following curl command,
pointed at the Restate runtime and with the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate dp add "arn:aws:lambda:my-region:123456789101:function:my-function:my-version"
```

Replace the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

```shell
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"arn": "arn:aws:lambda:my-region:123456789101:function:my-function:my-version"}'
```

Replace `<RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>` and the Lambda function ARN in the data field.
