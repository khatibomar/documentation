# Invocations
To invoke a handler, you sent the request to the Restate server (not directly to the component).
Restate then registers the request and drives the execution of the handler.

## Starting an invocation
The handlers of a component can be invoked in two ways:
- Over HTTP by sending a request to the Restate Server (ingress at port `8080`).
- Programmatically
    - From a Restate handler
    - via embedded typed clients.
- Over Kafka by letting Restate subscribe to a Kafka topic.

Invocations get a unique identifier. This identifier is used to track the progress of the invocation, and lets you correlate logs and metrics.

## Invocation types
- **One-way invocations** are used when you don't need a response from the handler.

- **Request-response invocations** are used when you need a response from the handler.

- **Delayed invocations** are used when you want to schedule a handler to be invoked at a later time.

## Idempotent invocations
You can add an idempotency key in the header of the request to make an inbound invocation idempotent.
Restate will then deduplicate requests with the same idempotency key, and will only execute the handler once.
Duplicate requests will get the same response as the first request, or will latch on to the first invocation if it's still running.

## Inspecting invocations
Restate proxies and manages inbound as well as service-to-service invocations.
This makes it a great source of observability data for your application.
You can inspect invocations via the CLI.

Restate also exposes traces via OpenTelemetry, which can be sent to your observability platform of choice (e.g. Jaeger).

## Cancelling and killing invocations

The Restate CLI allows you to cancel or kill invocations.
If necessary, you can register compensating actions in your handlers to ensure that the system remains consistent amid cancellations (blog post on [graceful cancellations](https://restate.dev/blog/graceful-cancellations-how-to-keep-your-application-and-workflow-state-consistent/)).

For cancellations, Restate will gracefully stop the handler by executing all compensation actions.
For kills, Restate will immediately stop the handler without executing any compensation actions.
