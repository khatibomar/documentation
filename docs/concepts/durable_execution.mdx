# Durable Execution

- Durable execution: what and why?
- Shows how durable execution works with a diagram similar to the homepage but a bit more detailed
- Explains how invocations get executed by the user code using the Restate context, the SDK journaling the interactions, and sending them to the runtime. And the runtime durably storing them in the log.
