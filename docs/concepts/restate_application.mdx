# Restate Application

A Restate application exists out of the following parts:

![Application overview](/img/application_overview.svg)

1. **Restate Server**: The server intercepts incoming requests and drives their execution till the end.
2. **Components**: The building blocks of the application which process incoming requests. These run like regular RPC services (e.g. a NodeJS app in a Docker container).
They have the SDK embedded as a dependency, which handles the communication with the Restate server. Components can be written in any language for which there is an SDK available (currently [TypeScript](/category/typescript-sdk) and [Java](/category/java-sdk)). There are two types of components:
    1. **Services**: expose a set of handlers on an endpoint. Each handler can be invoked over RPC. Handlers are independent, stateless, and can be invoked concurrently.
    2. **Virtual objects**: expose a bundled set of handlers with access to K/V state stored in Restate. Each virtual object has a key (unique identifier). Requests to a single virtual object (single key) are executed sequentially.
3. **Invocation**: A request to execute a handler that is part of either a service, or a virtual object. This request can come from the outside or from another handler.
